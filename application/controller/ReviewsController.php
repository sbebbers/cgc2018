Of course, I used to play a game of Footy over the park with jumpers for goal posts, but I just wasn't ever very Footy-ish, and always the last to be picked for any sporty-type thing, so when this sports sim landed I feared the worst. Would it be a joystick-breaking or keyboard-bashing affair? Yikes!",

In fact, at the time of writing, I've not yet managed a successful Luge run. And on the original sumbission (let's call it V1.0), the Luge event couldn't be completed, so that alone gets it an extra point!",

It's a new sort of sports sim for those of us who don't want to replace our olde keyboard membranes any time soon, whilst providing a significant challenge that'll keep you coming back time and again. Capture the Winter Olympic fervour with this fab game!",
