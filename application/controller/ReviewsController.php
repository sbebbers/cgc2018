Of course, I used to play a game of Footy over the park with jumpers for goal posts, but I just wasn't ever very Footy-ish, and always the last to be picked for any sporty-type thing, so when this sports sim landed I feared the worst. Would it be a joystick-breaking or keyboard-bashing affair? Yikes!",
